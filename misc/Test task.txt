Test task:


- To implement the animation of spinning like on video attached
- Symbols are described as two-dimensional array, the order is 


chaotic

- Round spin button should be placed below the reels (reel is the vertical column of symbols)


- When the spin button is pressed it gets disabled until the full stop of reels


- When the reels are spinning Reel_Spin.mp3 plays


- Position of reel stop is random. The interval between the reel stops is the same


- When the reel stops Landing_1.mp3 plays


- Reel starts to spin from the position it stopped on


- The end of reel array is the same to beggining so it spins cyclically
